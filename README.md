The dataset contains yes/no answers of the following 10 questions from a autism self-assessment questionnaire:

2. I prefer to do things the same way over and over again - This item examines
adherence to rou􀆟nes and resistance to change. People who agree with this
statement may display repe􀆟􀆟ve behaviors or rituals, which are common in
individuals with ASD.
3. I am fascinated by numbers - This item assesses a tendency towards an intense
interest in specific topics. While an interest in numbers alone does not indicate
au􀆟sm, it may suggest a preference for structured and detail-oriented thinking,
which is some􀆟mes associated with ASD.
4. I find social situa􀆟ons easy - This item evaluates social ease and comfort. People
who agree with this statement may find it easier to navigate social interac􀆟ons,

evaluates conversa􀆟onal skills and social communica􀆟on. People who agree with this

8. People o􀅌en tell me that I talk too much - This item examines verbosity and social
